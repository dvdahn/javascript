FUNCTION: calculate area with parameter to radius
        DECLARE area variable
        COMPARE the radius to less than or equal to 0 for valid input

        IF radius is invalid
            return 0
        ELSE 
            calculate area to pi * radius * radius
            then return the area
DECLARE radius as a variable with fixed number of 5.2
DECLARE theArea as a variable equaling to function and its radius
console log outputting the area's radius in a message
